title: "nf-core/sarek tutorial"
---

## Welcome

These pages are a tutorial workshop for the [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io) pipeline [nf-core/sarek](https://nf-co.re/sarek).

In this workshop, we will recap the application of next generation sequencing to identify genetic variations in a genome. You will learn how to use the pipeline sarek to carry out this data-intensive workflow efficiently. We will cover topics such as experimental design, configuration of the pipeline and code execution.

Please note that this is not an introductory workshop, and we will assume some basic familiarity with Nextflow.

By the end of this workshop, you will have the skills and knowledge to run the sarek workflow and customise some of its features for your own variant calling analyses.

Let's get started!
